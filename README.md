# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About me
Iâ€™m Soraya Woest, a third-year Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD) student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA).

Creativity is my fuel, and UI/UX design is my passion. With a year of experience as a UI designer, Iâ€™ve developed a keen interest in interaction and behavioral design. Iâ€™m fascinated by how we can create interfaces that are not only beautiful but also intuitive and user-centered. 

This portfolio shows a glimpse into my design journey. I am always looking for ways to learn and I would like to develop my skills in the upcoming years.

Discover how my enthusiasm for UX/UI design is reflected in my portfolio!
